# websocket_bruteforce

I work as a pentester and found a websocket IDOR and had do explore the vulnerability.
This script bruteforces said websocket idor with multiple threads.

This script is not optimized and provided as is.
i check github rarely so dont expect me to maintain it. You can use it however and you want, fix it to actually be a decent script, sell or do watever you want to, credits would be apreciated.

Ilegal use of this script is your own responsability.
